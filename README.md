# midpoint-karel
Midpoint Karel - Python - CS 106A

From the Code in Place course offered by Stanford University during the COVID-19 crisis in April 2020.

This is a challenge problem in Karel's world (the bot used for teaching). 
The idea is to find the midpoint in varying worlds and put a 'beeper' there.
